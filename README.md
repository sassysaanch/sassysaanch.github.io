## Final Project 

### 1. Instructions
It's time to become an MCH researcher! Your goal is to work in a team to determine associations between environmental exposures/habits and pregnancy outcomes. Use this [markdown](/Final/UniSA.Rmd) file to get started on your final project - more details to come later. Feel free to spend time on this website in the meanwhile (highly encouraged): [UniSA](https://data.unisa.edu.au/dap/Dataset.aspx?DatasetID=96137). For copyright reasons, I have not shared articles on github, however, I did link a couple of articles in the markdown file which I believe will be helpful as we develop some skills and try to emulate 10% of what the authors achieved using the PALS dataset. 

### 2. Data
Here is the [PALS](/Data/pals.csv) dataset in CSV format. Since this is the original dataset, it has all the variables as is (which is a lot). To make your life easier, I created a subset with a few variables and a few new variables. Should you want to use it as is, here you go: [PALS SUBSET](/Data/pals_subset.csv).
Here is the [codebook](/Data/palscodebook.pdf) for the original dataset which can also be found online.
Here is a document listing the variables I kept in the [subset dataset](/Final/pals_subset_var.docx).

My suggestion is to approach the paper/analysis in one of the 2 ways:
1. Association between dietary variables and birth weight

2. Association between term status and maternal health

### 3. Past projects using different data sources
a) Vitamin A Supplementation and Low Birth Weightâ€™s Relationship with Declining Under Five Mortality Rate in Africa from 2000-2015. Feel free to take a look [here](/Final/SampleStudentWHOProject.pdf).

b) Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Infections in California Across Community Type and Years. Feel free to take a look [here](/Final/SampleStudentCommunityProject.pdf).

Note: They did NOT use PALS. If you wish to use a different dataset or the WHO data most students have worked with in the past, let me know! Further, expectations for the paper were a little different and we used a different programming language in the past. Do not worry about all the graphs (some students were also very advanced and I had to modify some of the assignments accordingly).
