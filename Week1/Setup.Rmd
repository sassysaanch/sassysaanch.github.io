How to learn R?
(Re-linking resources here:)

2. [Introduction to R (interactive tool)](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/free-introduction-to-r)

3. [Youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@marinstatlectures)

4. [UCLA IDRE](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/stat/data/intro_r/intro_r_interactive_flat.html)

5. [UCLA Poli Sci Methods Mavens Resources](https://methodsmavens-psucla.github.io/)

6. [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

These are just a few resources to help you get started. That is the beauty of R, everyone uses R because it's free/open-source and there are a tonne of resources out there to help you along the way. I will keep mentioning resources as and when we develop some skills. It's up to you to decide how much you'd like to learn. I sincerely hope that you will attempt to follow along and perform the 'to do' tasks in addition to the practice sets.
